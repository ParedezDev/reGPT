# Task 1.6 Implementation: Multi-Head Self-Attention

## Implementation Overview

For Task 1.6, I implemented the Multi-Head Self-Attention mechanism using the Scaled Dot-Product Attention from Task 1.5. This is a key component of transformer models that allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces.

## Key Components

1. **MultiHeadSelfAttention Class**: A PyTorch module that:
   - Splits input into multiple attention heads
   - Applies scaled dot-product attention to each head
   - Concatenates and projects the results

2. **Linear Projections**:
   - Query, Key, and Value projections (W_q, W_k, W_v)
   - Output projection (W_o)

3. **Head Management**:
   - `split_heads()`: Reshapes tensors to separate the head dimension
   - `combine_heads()`: Merges the head dimension back into the model dimension

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the architecture described in "Attention Is All You Need" paper:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Validates that model dimension is divisible by number of heads
   - Creates linear projections for Q, K, V, and output
   - Initializes weights using Xavier uniform initialization

2. **Forward Pass**:
   - Projects inputs through linear layers
   - Splits projections into multiple heads
   - Applies scaled dot-product attention to all heads simultaneously
   - Combines heads and applies final projection

3. **Mask Handling**:
   - Supports different mask shapes (padding masks, causal masks)
   - Properly reshapes masks to work with multiple attention heads

## Fixes Made

During implementation, I encountered and fixed several issues:

1. **Initial Approach Issue**: The first implementation processed each head separately in a loop, which was inefficient and caused issues with mask broadcasting.

2. **Fix**: Refactored to process all heads simultaneously by:
   - Reshaping tensors to combine batch and head dimensions
   - Applying attention once to all heads
   - Reshaping results back to separate batch and head dimensions

3. **Mask Handling Fix**:
   - Added proper mask reshaping for different input mask shapes
   - Ensured masks are properly broadcast across all attention heads
   - Fixed dimension handling for both sequence-level and token-level masks

4. **Tensor Shape Management**:
   - Used `contiguous()` before reshaping to ensure memory layout is correct
   - Added proper dimension tracking throughout the forward pass
   - Fixed the combine_heads method to correctly reshape tensors

## Testing

The implementation was verified with comprehensive tests that check:

1. Output shapes are correct
2. Invalid dimensions raise appropriate errors
3. Masks are correctly applied
4. Head splitting and combining works correctly
5. Projection matrices have the correct shapes
6. Self-attention (where query = key = value) works as expected

All tests now pass, confirming that the Multi-Head Self-Attention implementation is working correctly.

## Performance Considerations

The implementation is optimized for both clarity and efficiency:

1. Processes all heads in parallel rather than sequentially
2. Minimizes tensor reshaping operations
3. Uses proper broadcasting for mask application
4. Maintains numerical stability throughout

This implementation provides a solid foundation for the subsequent components of our decoder-only transformer model.
